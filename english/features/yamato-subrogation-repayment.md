# Yamato Subrogation Repayment

When the health rate is less than 100%, a CJPY obligation remains even after redemption.

Such Pledges will be paid back in CJPY through Yamato subrogation. (The CJPY fees accumulated in Yamato is used for subrogation.)

The trigger executor gets 1% of the repayment amount in CJPY.&#x20;

Repayment proceeds in the order of occurrence of the target pledges. The repayment depends on availability of CJPY in pool hence the timing is not guaranteed.
