# Deposit & Withdrawal (ETH)

## ETH Deposit

Minimum deposit is 0.1 ETH.

Redemptions may cause user collateral to fall below 0.1 ETH. In such cases, there is no penalty and users can add deposit to meet minimum deposit of 0.1 ETH to continue using Dapp.

## ETH Withdrawal

User needs to retain at least 0.1 ETH of collateral if there are outstanding debt.

If there are no outstanding debt, user can fully withdraw ETH collateral.
