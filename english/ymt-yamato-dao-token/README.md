## What is veYMT？

veYMT is a non-transferable token obtained by locking YMT.&#x20;

1 YMT = 1 veYMT for a lock of up to 4 years. For a one-year lock, 1YMT = 0.25veYMT.&#x20;

It decays over time and the lock period can be extended to a maximum of 4 years at any time, but cannot be shortened or cancelled.

### Purpose of veYMT

Farming boost

YMT gauge voting

Indirect protocol fee acquisition (distribution of collateral through Yamato redemption)
