ðŸ‘‰ **User Rewards**

There are two types of user rewards: YMT rewards and Fee rewards.

YMT rewards are earned based on your outstanding CJPY borrowing in the Yamato Protocol.

These rewards are boosted based on your veYMT holdings and your collateral ratio.

You can check how the boost works [here](../ymt-yamato-dao-token/toveymtniyorufmingubsuto.md).

Fee rewards are distributed based on ETH collected from Yamato redemptions, according to veYMT holdings.

ðŸ‘‰ **How to Claim User Rewards**

In the middle of the veYMT interface, there is a section titled "YMT Portfolio."

When the YMT reward or Fee reward is not 0, the respective "Claim" buttons within the section become active. Click them.
